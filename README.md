# Todo List Api
Work in progress GraphQL backend for a todo list type app

## TODOs
 - Start a trello board
 - Split models and services into separate files somehow
 - Pass connection url to db pool create
 - Start passing around graphql context instead of db reference
 - Add a validation layer
 - Add an authentication layer
 - Password hashing may have to be done client side (see user_service.rs)

 ## Acknowledgements
 I'm a beginner to Rust and wouldn't have been able to make it very far had I not found [Luc Perkins' boiler plate project](https://github.com/lucperkins/rust-graphql-juniper-actix-diesel-postgres).
